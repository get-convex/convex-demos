# Hello Convex!

To get started you first need to install dependencies for the Convex CLI and SDK
as follows:

`(cd convex-sdk && npm install)`

`(cd convex-cli && npm install)`

Once you've successfully run these commands you can see `hello-convex/README.md`
for instructions on installing and running a basic counter application on
Convex.
